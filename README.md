Project: Recipe Finder

Description:
Create a recipe finder application where users can search for recipes, view recipe details, and save their favorite recipes.

Requirements:
1. Home Page:
   - Display a search form where users can enter a recipe keyword or ingredient.
   - When the form is submitted, navigate to the search results page.

2. Search Results Page:
   - Fetch and display a list of recipes based on the user's search query.
   - Each recipe should be clickable and navigate to its details page.

3. Recipe Details Page:
   - Show detailed information about a selected recipe, such as title, ingredients, instructions, and cooking time.
   - Display additional details like preparation time, servings, and dietary information.
   - Provide a button or link to allow users to go back to the search results page.

4. Favorites Page:
   - Create a favorites page that displays a list of recipes the user has marked as favorites.
   - Allow users to add or remove recipes from their favorites list.
   - Clicking on a recipe should navigate to its details page.

5. Routing:
   - Use React Router to set up the routing for the different pages (home, search results, recipe details, and favorites).
   - Each page should have its own URL, allowing users to navigate directly to specific pages.

6. API Integration:
   - Utilize a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular API or Edamam API) to fetch recipe data.
   - Implement the necessary API calls to retrieve search results and recipe details.

7. Styling:
   - Apply CSS or use a UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap) to style your application and make it visually appealing.

8. Additional Features (Optional):
   - Implement pagination for the search results to display a limited number of recipes per page.
   - Add sorting and filtering options for the recipe list.
   - Include images of the recipes in the search results and details page.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks, implement one task at a time, and test your application as you go. React Router will enable smooth navigation between different pages, enhancing the user experience. Good luck with your mini project!
